/**
 * This ruleset enforces a strict, user-centric security model for the EcoSort AI application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is based on user ownership. All user-generated data, including profiles
 * and waste identification history, is stored within a path structure that is unique to each
 * user. This ensures that a user can only ever access their own data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * The data is organized hierarchically. A top-level 'users' collection holds individual user
 * documents. All related data, such as 'wasteIdentifications', is stored in subcollections
 * under the specific user's document (e.g., /users/{userId}/wasteIdentifications/{wasteId}).
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User Privacy: Listing the top-level '/users' collection is strictly forbidden to prevent
 *   any user from discovering or enumerating other users of the application.
 * - Strict Ownership: All read and write operations are gated by checking if the authenticated
 *   user's ID matches the user ID in the document path.
 * - Authorization Integrity: To ensure data consistency, rules validate that internal ID
 *   fields (e.g., 'User.id', 'WasteIdentification.userId') match the user ID in the
 *   document path upon creation and are immutable upon update. This prevents data from being
 *   associated with the wrong user.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * The `WasteIdentification` documents contain a `userId` field. This denormalization is crucial
 * as it allows security rules to validate on document creation that the data being written
 * rightfully belongs to the user specified in the path, without needing any extra document reads.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The database structure naturally segregates each user's data into their own document tree.
 * This makes security rules simple and highly performant, as access is determined by the
 * path itself rather than by filtering on fields within a shared collection.
